Complete these steps to install chromeGamification
# 1 Prerequisites
1. Apache Couch DB
I used couch DB v1.6.1 (if utils page does not say ADMIN PARTY, you will need to manually add the databases 'chromeGamification_config' and 'chromeGamification_data' before completing install). More information on installing CouchDB can be found [here (v2.1.1)](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/2.1.1/install/index.html) or [here (v1.6.1)](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/1.6.1/install/index.html)
2. Apache2 web server or equivalent that accepts https requests
I used Apache2 with a self-signed SSL Cert. if you use a self-signed cert, users may have an issue with loading their progress bar and logs, combat this with providing them with a direct link to the progress.php file on your web server so they can proceed to the unsecured site
3. PHP 5.7
